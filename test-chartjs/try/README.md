See the `package.json`file and (the getting started page of the chart.js library)[https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/usage.html] to install the corresponding test.  
  
***The `package.json`file needs to be created before running `$ npm install command`***
  
To execute those test, first install the libraries and dependencies needed :
 - `$ npm install chart.js && npm install parcel npm install`  

Then you can execute with the following command :
 - `$ npm run dev`
