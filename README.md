# test-js-steamgraph
d3js and chart.js testing to generate steamgraph.  
  
In the end, the goal is to be able to generate all sort of data visualisation, with categorized data, and to apply a method that will optimise the color affectation to each data category.  
At the time, and in this repository, I will only be trying to generate steamgraph, while extracting the color of the construction of the steamgraph.  
This way, I would be able to pass the optimized set of color later.
